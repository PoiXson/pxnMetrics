<h3 class="pb-2 text-center">PoiXson Community Charter</h3>

<p>A collective of <strong>free thinkers</strong>. We stand firmly with <strong>freedom</strong> and steadfast rejecting greed. In a world dominated by greed, you will have nothing and do as others say. As a sentient human, you deserve better. It starts with you. Make the world a better place for everyone. End the greed. Create great things and allow others to enjoy them.</p>

<p>We intentionally <strong>avoid corporate sponsors</strong> to maintain independence and integrity. Your donations allow us to support community projects, uplift individual creators, and strengthen our collective impact.</p>

<h3 class="pb-2 text-center">The pxnMetrics Project</h3>

<strong>pxnMetrics</strong> provides statistics and trends for many Minecraft platforms, plugins, and mods. Developers can view how many players are enjoying the things they make, inspiring the creation of even more great things. Server admins get insights into the trends of software. Players can make informed choices with trusted transparent information. The Minecraft community is stronger as a whole if we work together. We can't support one major platform and not another. Open source software can bring us all together.

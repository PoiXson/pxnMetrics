add the database sync calls, and then batching

what is the best way and place to store these simple databases, which are just maps in memory

it will be requests per IP, and requests per server UID

[1:50 AM]lorenzop: the shards will call to the broker every sync-interval. it will send and receive updates to the IP and UID databases, and check for a do-batch flag for that shard index. if it's true then the shard knows to perform a batchout and start accumulating data in a new chip
[2:18 AM]lorenzop: I take a look at mcmetrics.net, oh I see they have a toxicity chart, how does that work?... oh, they send all chat messages back to their  proprietary servers.....
